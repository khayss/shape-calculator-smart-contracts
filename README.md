# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```

Test 1: Area Calculator
Create a Solidity contract that calculates the area of a triangle, rectangle, and square. The contract should have separate functions for each shape.
Deploy the contract and submit contract address with your name, wallet address and contract address.
Use hardhat or foundry to deploy
